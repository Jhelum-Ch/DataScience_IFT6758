### Welcome note    
Welcome to the Data Science Course! 
The goal of this course is to introduce the concepts (theory and practice) needed to approach and solve data science problems. The first part of the course will cover the principles of analyzing data, the basics about different kinds of models and statistical inference. The second part expands into the statistical methods and practical techniques to deal with common modalities of data - image, text and graphs. Specific programming frameworks required for data science will be covered in the lab sessions.  

### Prerequisites
* Programming (Python)
* Undergrad-level Statistics 
* Basic Probability Theory

### Topics covered
1. Data Visualization	
2. Function Fitting	
3. Supervised and Unsupervised learning	
4. Cross-validation
5. Model Selection	
6. Bootstrapping
7. Statistical Inference	
8. Feature Engineering
9. Outlier and error analysis 	
10. Algorithmic Bias	
11. Special Topics: Overview of deep learning and reinforcement learning 
12. Images - Computer Vision	
13. Text - Natural Language Processing	
14. Graph Learning


### Evaluation

| Component        | Weightage  |
| :-------------:| -----:|
| Homeworks (4 HWs - individual submission) | 30 % |
| Midterm Exam                              | 30 % |
| Data challenge (Kaggle)                   | 15 % |
| Final course project                      | 25 % |


### Labs
The labs would essentially be tutorial sessions to learn about various essential frameworks and tools used in data science. It will be a chance to apply the ideas gained from the lectures using python programming. These are also opportunities to get familiar with these frameworks and gain practice to do the data challenge and the final course project, and of course to apply them to your own data science problems that you deal with later. 

Some framewrks/libraries that would be covered in the lab sessions are :
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib	
4. pandas	
5. scikit-learn
6. keras	
7. OpenCV	
8. NLTK
